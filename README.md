Python Sample Structure

1. Create a folder for each project you work on (even if it's a single python file)
2. Create virtual environment
3. Start git repository inside of the app using git init
4. Create main.py file
5. Create README.md
6. Add .gitignore
7. git add & git commit -m "initial commit"
8. actually upload the folder to github (i.e., gh repo create)
9. Lastly, pip freeze > requirement.txt to ensure everyone you work with has the same version of libraries
